[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findi2c.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "i2c", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "i2c" with any of
  the following names:

    i2cConfig.cmake
    i2c-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "i2c" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "i2c_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "i2c" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
